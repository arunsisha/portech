                        <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-2">With years of experience, we are also your partner when it comes to crane modernisation. A retrofit, for example, requires a particularly large amount of specialist knowledge. It is not only important to systematically replace damage components but also to conduct modifications to retain compliance with the frequent changes in safety regulations, from limit switches to automatic monitoring systems. We also undertake up gradation of complete electrical system of crane. This may include up gradation of Electrical Drives, PLC and refurbishment of complete electrical system.Thanks to our know-how, we can ensure that your current crane systems continue to work productively and without any problems for many more decades
<br>
<br>Study of Crane Operation to determine duty cycle, Crane audit, Visual observation, dimensional verification, NDT testing of critical members to determine residual thickness of load bearing structures, measurement of speeds of Hoist, measurement of motor currents, measurement of crane girder deflection under load and analysis of structures using computerised software such as STAAD &amp; ANSYS are some of the technique that we employ to determine whether the crane is suitable for upgradation.</p>

Our team has solid experience to carry out Health Check Up of cranes. Periodic Inspection of Cranes is to be carried as per OEM standard.Depending on duration of operation and the factory operating conditions, the cranes need to be inspected by an experienced technician or an Expert Engineer.
<br>
<br>Expert Engineers are engineers experienced in the design, construction or maintenance of cranes with sufficient knowledge of the regulations and standards. The expert Engineers should be in a position to judge the safe condition of the crane and to decide which measures shall be taken in order to ensure further safe operation.
<br>
<br>Periodic Health Check-up of Cranes highlights the shortcomings in the existing system and the need for repair/ replacement of parts. It also helps in planning for spare parts as well as the repairs can be done during planned shutdown rather than attending to breakdowns.</p>
